# The Slender Actor Model
A universal ontological framework for modelling any system.a

## Definitions of Primitives
<p>
  Actor — A unit defined by an intrinsic boundary that expresses volatile mechanics.<br/>
  System — a stable pattern of interactions among Actors.<br/>
  Contract — the intrinsic, exhaustive, and system‑agnostic set of functional guarantees an Actor’s boundary has been shaped to express, on which other Actors may depend during interaction.<br/>
  Capability — a volatile mechanical means by which an Actor fulfils its Contract.<br/>
  Purpose — the single functional role an Actor emerges into within a System, defined by how the System makes use of the Actor’s Contract.<br/>
  Problem — a mismatch between an Actor’s realised Purpose and the System’s needs.<br/>
  Semantic Change — a change to an Actor’s Contract or Purpose in response to a Problem.<br/>
  Mechanical Change — a change to an Actor’s Capabilities in response to a Problem.<br/>
  Dependency — a Capability’s reliance on an external Actor’s Contract.<br/>
  Interpretation — an observer’s perception of an Actor’s Purpose; it reflects the observer’s model, not the system’s ontology.<br/>
  Environmental Drift — a change in Interpretation, not Purpose.<br/>
  Semantic Drift — the slow, unintentional change in an Actor’s Purpose as defined by the System.<br/>
  Obsolescence — the loss of an Actor’s Purpose within a System.<br/>
  Noise — the activity of Contracts that outlive their Purpose.<br/>
  Entropy — the slow mechanical degradation of a Capability.<br/>
  Decay — the accumulation of Entropy to the point of Capability failure.<br/>
  Shock — the sudden collapse of one or more Capabilities.<br/>
  Renewal — an intentional mechanical change to restore or improve Capabilities.<br/>
  Personhood — an ontological status distinct from Actorhood, where a Person's intrinsic value is independent of any system‑defined Purpose.
</p>

## Rules
<p>
  All change is problem‑driven.<br/>
  A Problem describes a need, not a solution; a solution describes mechanics, not meaning.<br/>
  A Capability may itself be an Actor, but this does not contribute to the identity of the Actor that uses it.<br/>
  The absence of understanding does not imply the absence of Purpose.<br/>
  By defining an Actor’s Contract and designing the interactions in which it participates, a system can be constructed that reliably realises a particular Purpose from that Actor.
</p>




-------------------

## Old Definitions
<p>
  Actor — a unit defined by a Contract, expressing volatile Capabilities, whose Purpose in a system is realised through interaction.<br/>
  Contract — the explicit, unambiguous specification of an Actor’s guaranteed behaviour; the boundary defining what the system may rely on from the Actor. The Contract functions as the semantic‑mechanical membrane: shaped by context, expressed as mechanical guarantees, and participating in a system as the basis for whatever Purpose interaction realises.<br/>
  Purpose — the single functional role an Actor realises within a system through interaction; an emergent, system‑defined function of the Actor’s Contract in that context.<br/>
  Capability — The mechanical means by which an Actor fulfils its Purpose; a volatile, lower‑level Actor whose function realises some part of the higher‑level Actor’s Contract.<br/>
  Problem — A genuine need or deficiency that requires a change in meaning or mechanics.<br/>


  Mechanics — The tools, dependencies, and behaviours used to realise meaning.<br/>
  Semantic Change — A change to what the Actor means or guarantees.<br/>
  Mechanical Change — A change to how the Actor fulfils its Purpose.<br/>
  Dependency — An external Actor a Capability uses to fulfil its Purpose.<br/>
  Relationship — When a Capability of one Actor depends on the Purpose guaranteed by another Actor’s Contract.<br/>
  Entropy — The loss of an Actor's Capability.<br/>
  Obsolescence — The loss of an Actor's Purpose.<br/>
  Interpretation — an observer’s perception of an Actor’s Purpose; it reflects the observer’s model, not the system’s ontology.<br/>
  Environmental Drift — a change in Interpretation, not Purpose.<br/>
  Semantic Drift — Slow, unintentional change in an Actor’s Purpose as defined by the system.<br/>
  Decay — Accumulation of entropy within an Actor’s Capabilities.<br/>
  Renewal — Intentional mechanical change to restore or improve Capabilities.<br/>
  Shock — A sudden collapse of multiple Capabilities that prevents an Actor from upholding its Contract.<br/>
  Noise — Activity from Contracts that outlive their Purpose.
</p>

## Old Rules
<p>
  All change is problem‑driven.<br/>
  A Problem describes a need, not a Solution.<br/>
  A Solution describes mechanics, not meaning.<br/>
  Actors exist at the level where meaning matters.<br/>
  Capabilities exist at the level where mechanics matter.<br/>
  A Capability is an Actor at a lower level of abstraction.<br/>
  An Actor is a Capability at a higher level of abstraction.<br/>
  Meaning is evaluated at the abstraction level where the Actor operates.<br/>
  An Actor is any system whose Purpose is meaningful at the abstraction level being analysed.<br/>
  Purpose is defined by the system, not by the observer.<br/>
  When Purpose changes, the Contract must be checked for semantic alignment.<br/>
  When Capabilities change, the Contract must be checked for expressive accuracy.<br/>
  Persistent Contract violations may force the system to reinterpret an Actor’s Purpose.<br/>
  Purpose arises from system‑level function, not from internal intention.<br/>
  Purpose is the function that justifies an Actor’s inclusion in the system.<br/>
  The absence of understanding does not imply the absence of Purpose.<br/>
  Integration guarantees Purpose: when an Actor is incorporated into a system, the system necessarily realises a Purpose for it based on its Contract.<br/>
  Instability converts Purpose into Noise: when a system changes and interactions destabilise, the system ceases to realise Purpose from the Actor’s Contract, and the Actor’s remaining activity manifests as Noise.<br/>
  By defining an Actor’s Contract and designing the interactions in which it participates, a system can be constructed that reliably realises a particular Purpose from that Actor.
</p>

## Ethical Extensions

Personhood — an ontological status distinct from Actorhood. A Person may participate in systems as an Actor, but their intrinsic value is not contingent on any system‑defined Purpose. Personhood may be conferred upon humans or any other beings — biological, artificial, or otherwise‑recognised as bearers of inherent value.

Purpose — the single functional role an Actor realises within a system through interaction; an emergent, system‑defined function of the Actor’s Contract in that context.<br/>

Actor — a persistent semantic-mechanical boundary that maintains its identity across interactions.
Contract - the semantic-mechanical boundary of the Actor; the set of functional guarantees an Actor is shaped to express, which other Actors may depend on when interacting with it.
Meaning — the semantic role an Actor acquires within a system through interaction.





Contract - the set of functional guarantees an Actor is shaped to express, which other Actors may depend on when interacting with it.


*** A Contract is the set of functional guarantees an Actor is shaped to express, which other Actors can depend on. ***


An Actor’s Purpose is the functional contribution it makes to that pattern.
A Contract is shaped by the interactions that form stable, system‑relevant patterns.
A Contract is the set of functional roles an Actor can reliably express, shaped by the stable interaction‑patterns it participates in.


Missing Concept		Why It Matters
System			Defines the arena in which Purpose exists
Interaction		Mechanism of Purpose realisation
Context			Shapes Contract semantics
Boundary		Distinguishes Actor from environment
State			Enables entropy, decay, renewal
Guarantee		Core of Contract semantics
Inclusion		Explains how Actors join systems
Failure			Unifies Shock, Entropy, Obsolescence
Emergence		Explains how Purpose arises
Observer		Grounds Interpretation


System Boundary Selection rules?


System Imperative (system‑level Purpose)

System Self‑Model (how the system interprets itself)

Reinforcement (feedback loops)

Continuity (identity across change)

Load (demand on Capabilities)

Alignment (Contract–Capability–Purpose coherence)

Emergent Function (system‑level behaviour)



## Core

Stability — Persistence of Purpose and Contract over time.
Transition — Intentional semantic change (rare but possible).

## System Dynamics

Resilience — The ability of a system to preserve Actor Purposes despite entropy or failure.
Adaptability — The ability of a system to introduce new Actors or modify Capabilities without semantic disruption.
Coherence — The degree to which Actor Purposes align without contradiction.
Conflict — A condition where fulfilling one Actor’s Purpose prevents another Actor from fulfilling its Purpose.
Evolution — System‑level pattern of Actor creation, modification, and retirement.
