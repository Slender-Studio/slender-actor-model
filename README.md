# The Slender Actor Model - cross-discipline semantic systems modelling.

<p>An Actor is a unit of stable Purpose protected by a Contract and realised through volatile Capabilities.</p>

<p>
  All change is problem‑driven.<br/>
  A Problem describes a need, not a Solution.<br/>
  A Solution describes mechanics, not meaning.<br/>
  An Actor’s Purpose defines its meaning, and must be unambiguous.<br/>
  An Actor’s Contract expresses its Purpose in mechanical form.<br/>
  An Actor’s Capabilities fulfil its Purpose mechanically.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  Purpose - Why an Actor exists within a system.<br/>
  Contract - What an Actor provides to the system.<br/>
  Capabilities - How an Actor fulfils its Purpose.<br/>
  Problem - A genuine need or deficiency that requires a change in meaning or mechanics.<br/>
  Meaning - The semantic content of an Actor’s Purpose — what the Actor represents or guarantees.<br/>
  Mechanics - The tools, dependencies, and behaviours used to realise meaning.<br/>
  Boundary - The membrane that separates an Actor’s meaning from its mechanics (i.e. Contract).<br/>
  Semantic Change - A change to what the Actor means or guarantees.<br/>
  Mechanical Change - A change to how the Actor fulfils its meaning.<br/>
  Dependency - An external mechanism a Capability uses to fulfil meaning.
</p>

<p>
  Actors exist at the level where meaning matters.<br/>
  Capabilities exist at the level where mechanics matter.
</p>

# The Evolutionary Model of Actors

<p>
  Entropy is the natural drift that pulls Actors away from their Purpose by degrading their Capabilities and eroding their Contracts over time.
</p>
<p>
  The Actor lifecycle:<br/>
  Conception → Definition → Stability → Drift → Crisis → Renewal → Stability → … <br/>
  Crisis is the branching point: the Actor either renews, decomposes, composes, or dies.<br/>
  Decomposition → the Actor splits into multiple Actors because its Purpose was overloaded or ambiguous<br/>
  Composition → the Actor merges with others because their Purposes converge
