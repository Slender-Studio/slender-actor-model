# The Slender Actor Model
A cross-discipline framework for modelling stable semantic systems.

<p>Within a system, an Actor is a unit of stable Purpose protected by a Contract and realised through volatile Capabilities.</p>

## Definitions
<p>
  Purpose - An unambiguous reason why an Actor exists within a system.<br/>
  Contract - Expresses the Actor's Purpose in mechanical form; what an Actor provides to the system.<br/>
  Capabilities - How an Actor fulfils its Purpose mechanically.<br/>
  Problem - A genuine need or deficiency that requires a change in meaning or mechanics.<br/>
  Meaning - The semantic content of an Actor’s Purpose — what the Actor represents or guarantees.<br/>
  Mechanics - The tools, dependencies, and behaviours used to realise meaning.<br/>
  Boundary - The membrane that separates an Actor’s meaning from its mechanics (i.e. Contract).<br/>
  Semantic Change - A change to what the Actor means or guarantees.<br/>
  Mechanical Change - A change to how the Actor fulfils its meaning.<br/>
  Dependency - An external Actor a Capability uses to fulfil meaning.<br/>
  Entropy - The loss of an Actor's Capability.<br/>
  Obsolescence - The loss of an Actor's Purpose.
</p>

## Rules
<p>
  All change is problem‑driven.<br/>
  A Problem describes a need, not a Solution.<br/>
  A Solution describes mechanics, not meaning.<br/>
  Actors exist at the level where meaning matters.<br/>
  Capabilities exist at the level where mechanics matter.<br/>
  A Capability is an Actor at a lower level of abstraction.
