# The Slender Actor Model
A cross-discipline ontological framework for modelling stable semantic systems.

<p>Within a system, an Actor is a unit of stable Purpose protected by a Contract and realised through volatile Capabilities.</p>

## Definitions
<p>
  Purpose - The unambiguous reason an Actor exists within a system; what the Actor represents or guarantees.<br/>
  Contract - Expresses the Actor's Purpose in mechanical form; what an Actor provides to the system.<br/>
  Capabilities - How an Actor fulfils its Purpose mechanically.<br/>
  Problem - A genuine need or deficiency that requires a change in meaning or mechanics.<br/>
  Mechanics - The tools, dependencies, and behaviours used to realise meaning.<br/>
  Semantic Change - A change to what the Actor means or guarantees.<br/>
  Mechanical Change - A change to how the Actor fulfils its Purpose.<br/>
  Dependency - An external Actor a Capability uses to fulfil its Purpose.<br/>
  Relationship – When a Capability of one Actor depends on the Purpose guaranteed by another Actor’s Contract.<br/>
  Entropy - The loss of an Actor's Capability.<br/>
  Obsolescence - The loss of an Actor's Purpose.<br/>
  Drift — Slow, unintentional semantic change in an Actor’s Purpose or Contract.<br/>
  Decay — Accumulation of entropy within an Actor’s Capabilities.<br/>
  Renewal — Intentional mechanical change to restore or improve Capabilities.
</p>

## Rules
<p>
  All change is problem‑driven.<br/>
  A Problem describes a need, not a Solution.<br/>
  A Solution describes mechanics, not meaning.<br/>
  Actors exist at the level where meaning matters.<br/>
  Capabilities exist at the level where mechanics matter.<br/>
  A Capability is an Actor at a lower level of abstraction.<br/>
  An Actor is a Capability at a higher level of abstraction.<br/>
  Meaning is evaluated at the abstraction level where the Actor operates.<br/>
  An Actor is any system whose Purpose is meaningful at the abstraction level being analysed.
</p>

# -- Work in Progress --

## Core

Stability — Persistence of Purpose and Contract over time.
Transition — Intentional semantic change (rare but possible).

## System Dynamics

Resilience — The ability of a system to preserve Actor Purposes despite entropy or failure.
Adaptability — The ability of a system to introduce new Actors or modify Capabilities without semantic disruption.
Coherence — The degree to which Actor Purposes align without contradiction.
Conflict — A condition where fulfilling one Actor’s Purpose prevents another Actor from fulfilling its Purpose.
Evolution — System‑level pattern of Actor creation, modification, and retirement.
