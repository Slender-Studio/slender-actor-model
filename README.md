# The Slender Actor Model
An intentionally minimal, pattern‑first, universal meta‑ontology for modelling any system.

## Definitions of Terms
- Actor — a conceptually bounded unit whose boundary defines its identity and within which volatile mechanics may operate.
- Contract — the exhaustive, system‑agnostic, and mutable set of functional guarantees that are intrinsic to the Actor’s boundary, shaped to be expressed through that boundary.
- Interaction — a reliance of one Actor on another Actor’s Contract within a given System.
- System — a recurrent pattern of Interactions.
- Emergent Actor — an Actor whose identity arises by bounding the recurring Interaction patterns that constitute a System.
- Fundamental Actor — an Actor that exists as bounded unit independently of any System’s Interaction patterns.
- Capability — a volatile mechanical means by which an Actor fulfils its Contract; it does not contribute to the Actor’s identity and may be realised by an Actor or a System.
- Purpose — the single functional role an Actor emerges into within a given System, defined by how that System makes use of the Actor’s Contract.
- Problem — a genuine deficiency, relative to an Actor’s Contract or a given System’s pattern of Interactions, that requires a change in meaning or mechanics.
- Semantic Change — the modification of an Actor’s Contract or Purpose in response to a Problem.
- Mechanical Change — the modification of an Actor’s Capabilities in response to a Problem.
- Dependency — a Capability’s mechanical reliance on an external Actor’s Contract.
- Interpretation — an observer’s perception of an Actor’s Purpose; it reflects the observer’s model, not a given System’s ontology.
- Observational Drift — a change in Interpretation, not Purpose; may contribute to Semantic Drift when Interpretation influences a given System’s pattern of Interactions.
- Semantic Drift — a change in an Actor’s Purpose within a given System caused by changes in that System’s pattern of Interactions, which may lead to a Problem.
- Obsolescence — the loss of an Actor’s Purpose within a given System.
- Noise — the continued operation of an Actor’s Capabilities, fulfilling the Actor’s Contract after the Actor’s Purpose is no longer realised in a given System.
- Entropy — the slow mechanical degradation of a Capability.
- Decay — the accumulation of Entropy to the point of Capability failure.
- Shock — the sudden mechanical collapse of one or more Capabilities.
- Renewal — a Mechanical Change that restores or improves Capabilities in response to mechanical deficiency.
- Personhood — an ontological status distinct from Actorhood. A Person may participate in Systems as an Actor, but no Actor’s Contract or Purpose exhausts or defines a Person's intrinsic value.

## Rules
- A Problem describes a need, not a solution; a solution describes mechanics, not meaning.
- A Contract describes all functional guarantees an Actor is shaped to expose, not only those a given System currently relies on.
- When Purpose changes, the Contract must be checked for semantic alignment.
- When Capabilities change, the Contract must be checked for expressive accuracy.
- A System is established when a recurrent Interaction pattern is bounded, regardless of whether it is stable, orderly, intentional, or long‑lived.
- An Emergent Actor is established when that bounded pattern is treated as a unit with identity.
- An Actor persists as long as its boundary remains meaningful, regardless of whether it is active or participating in any System.
- The absence of understanding does not imply the absence of Purpose.
- When a Person is modelled as an Actor within a given System, this is a functional abstraction that does not capture their full ontological status as a Person.

## Notes

- SAM is a pattern‑first ontology.
- Systems are patterns, not objects.
- Purpose is contextual, not intrinsic.
- Emergent Actors arise from patterns but do not replace them.
