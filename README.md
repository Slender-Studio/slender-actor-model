# The Slender Actor Model - cross-discipline semantic systems modelling.

An Actor is a unit of stable Purpose protected by a Contract and realised through volatile Capabilities.

All change is problem‑driven.
A Problem describes a need, not a Solution.
A Solution describes mechanics, not meaning.
An Actor’s Purpose defines its meaning, and must be unambiguous.
An Actor’s Contract expresses its Purpose in mechanical form.
An Actor’s Capabilities fulfil its Purpose mechanically.

Purpose - Why an Actor exists within a system.
Contract - What an Actor provides to the system.
Capabilities - How an Actor fulfils its Purpose.

Problem - A genuine need or deficiency that requires a change in meaning or mechanics.
Meaning - The semantic content of an Actor’s Purpose — what the Actor represents or guarantees.
Mechanics - The tools, dependencies, and behaviours used to realise meaning.
Boundary - The membrane that separates an Actor’s meaning from its mechanics (i.e. Contract).
Semantic Change - A change to what the Actor means or guarantees.
Mechanical Change - A change to how the Actor fulfils its meaning.
Dependency - An external mechanism a Capability uses to fulfil meaning.

Actors exist at the level where meaning matters.
Capabilities exist at the level where mechanics matter.


# The Evolutionary Model of Actors

Entropy is the natural drift that pulls Actors away from their Purpose by degrading their Capabilities and eroding their Contracts over time.
The Actor lifecycle:
Conception → Definition → Stability → Drift → Crisis → Renewal → Stability → … 
Only Crisis → Death ends the cycle
