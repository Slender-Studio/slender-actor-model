# Example - A bird's feather

## TERMS

### Actor
A Feather is an Actor because it is a conceptually bounded unit whose boundary defines its identity, regardless of how it is used.

### Contract
The Feather’s Contract includes all functional guarantees it is shaped to expose:
aerodynamic shaping, insulation, waterproofing, signalling, and protection.
These guarantees exist whether or not any System currently uses them.

### Interaction
When airflow relies on the Feather’s aerodynamic shaping, this is an Interaction:
one Actor relying on another Actor’s Contract within a System.

### System
Flight is a System: a recurring pattern of Interactions among feathers, wings, airflow, and muscular control.

### Capability
When modelling the Bird, thermoregulation is a Capability of the Bird.
The Feather becomes one mechanical means by which that Capability is realised.

### Purpose
Within the Flight System, the Feather’s Purpose is aerodynamic shaping.
Purpose is defined by how the System makes use of the Feather’s Contract.

### Problem
A Feather with damaged barbules cannot fulfil aerodynamic shaping.
This is a Problem: a deficiency relative to its Contract or a System’s pattern.

### Semantic Change
If the Bird begins using the Feather for display rather than insulation, the Feather’s Purpose changes.
This is Semantic Change: meaning changes, not mechanics.

### Mechanical Change
Preening realigns barbs and barbules.
This is Mechanical Change: modifying Capabilities to restore or improve function.

### Dependency
The Feather’s aerodynamic Capability depends on the Wing’s Contract (surface continuity, structural support).
This is a Dependency.

### Interpretation
An observer may interpret a Feather’s Purpose as “display” due to colouration, even when the Bird uses it for insulation.
Interpretation reflects the observer’s model, not the System’s ontology.

### Environmental Drift
Seasonal changes alter how observers interpret the Feather (e.g., “fluffed for warmth”).
Interpretation shifts, but Purpose does not.

### Semantic Drift
If the Bird stops flying (e.g., during moulting), the Feather’s Purpose within the Flight System changes.
This is Semantic Drift: Purpose changes because System patterns change.

### Obsolescence
Once detached, the Feather loses its Purpose in all Systems.
It becomes obsolete within those Systems.

### Noise
A detached Feather still insulates (fulfilling its Contract), but no System relies on it.
This is Noise.

### Entropy
UV exposure and abrasion slowly degrade barbules.
This is Entropy: gradual mechanical degradation.

### Decay
When barbules no longer interlock, aerodynamic shaping fails.
This is Decay: accumulated Entropy leading to Capability failure.

### Shock
A predator strike removes multiple feathers at once.
This is Shock: sudden mechanical collapse of Capabilities.

### Renewal
Growing a new Feather replaces a degraded one.
This is Renewal: Mechanical Change that restores or improves Capabilities.

### Personhood
A Person may study, collect, or use a Feather as an Actor within a System,
but the Feather’s Contract or Purpose does not define the Person’s intrinsic value.

### Emergent Actor
Flight is an Emergent Actor: its behaviour arises from recurring Interaction patterns among feathers, wings, airflow, and muscular control.
The Feather contributes by exposing aerodynamic shaping from its Contract.

### Fundamental Actor
The Feather is a Fundamental Actor: its identity exists as a bounded unit independently of any System’s Interaction patterns.
It participates in Emergent Actors but is not emergent itself.

## RULES

### A Problem describes a need, not a solution; a solution describes mechanics, not meaning.
A damaged Feather presents a Problem (reduced aerodynamic shaping). Preening is a solution, but the Problem is the deficiency itself.

### A Contract describes all functional guarantees an Actor is shaped to expose, not only those a given System currently relies on.
Even if the Bird never uses the Feather for waterproofing, waterproofing remains part of the Feather’s Contract.

### When Purpose changes, the Contract must be checked for semantic alignment.
Within the Display System, a Feather’s Purpose may shift from camouflage to signalling as the Bird enters mating season. The Feather’s Contract must be checked to ensure its guarantees (colouration, pattern, reflectivity) still align with the new Purpose within the same System.

### When Capabilities change, the Contract must be checked for expressive accuracy.
If barbules degrade, the Feather’s aerodynamic Capability changes. The Bird must check whether the Feather’s Contract still accurately expresses aerodynamic shaping.

### A System is established when a recurrent Interaction pattern is bounded, regardless of whether it is stable, orderly, intentional, or long‑lived.
The recurring pattern of feathers, wings, airflow, and muscular control becomes the Flight System once bounded, regardless of whether the pattern is stable, orderly, intentional, or long‑lived.

### An Emergent Actor is established when that bounded pattern is treated as a unit with identity.
When the bounded Flight pattern is treated as a single unit with identity, it becomes the Emergent Actor “Flight,” persisting as long as its boundary remains meaningful.

### An Actor persists as long as its boundary remains meaningful, regardless of whether it is active or participating in any System.
A Feather remains an Actor even when inactive, detached, or not participating in any System, because its identity is defined by its boundary, not its activity.

### The absence of understanding does not imply the absence of Purpose.
A human observer may not understand why a Feather is patterned a certain way, but the Feather still has a Purpose within the Bird’s Systems.

### When a Person is modelled as an Actor within a given System, this is a functional abstraction that does not capture their full ontological status as a Person.
A Person using a Feather (e.g., writing with a quill) is modelled functionally, but this does not capture their full ontological status as a Person.
